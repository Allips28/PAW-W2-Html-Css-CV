                <p class="card-text">
                  At Telkom University Jakarta, where I am an active student in the Information Systems program, I balance my academic pursuits with organizational involvement. I currently hold a GPA of 3.8, reflecting my commitment to my studies. My primary interests are in programming, business process development, and project management.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In my academic journey, I have gained valuable knowledge in various programming languages, including Python, Java, and C#. My passion for technology is complemented by my active role in the Marketing Crew at Telkom University Jakarta, where I serve as an editor in the Design Division. In this position, my key responsibility is to edit vlogcast videos, which has further honed my creative and technical skills.

                  My time in vocational high school was a pivotal period where I finally found my true passion and aptitude in the world of IT. I became a highly engaged student in the Software Engineering program, consistently achieving academic excellence by ranking in the top 10, and occasionally the top 5, of my class.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Beyond academics, I actively sought out opportunities to apply my skills. I frequently took part in various competitions, specializing in web development and UI/UX design. One of my proudest achievements was winning second place in a national web development competition. My leadership skills were also developed through my two-year tenure as the head of documentation for the Student Council, where I gained valuable experience in project coordination and team management.
